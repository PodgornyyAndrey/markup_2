				<h1>About Us</h1>
				<p>The BrightStars quality rating and improvement system was developed by a team of local early childhood and school-age care  . Parents with children enrolled in child care and early learning programs were consulted to better understand the information that would be most helpful for families. BrightStars is managed by the Rhode Island Association for the Education of Young Children (RIAEYC).Rhode Island KIDS COUNT coordinated the design phase and continues to provide support for evaluation and marketing. </p>
				<p>Special thanks to United Way of Rhode Island for providing the funding to design and launch BrightStars.</p>
